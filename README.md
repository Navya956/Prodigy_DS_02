ðŸ“Š Visualizing the Distribution of a Variable
To better understand the data, it's useful to visualize the distribution of both categorical and continuous variables. This helps reveal patterns, imbalances, and potential insights at a glance.

ðŸŸ¦ Example 1: Distribution of Gender (Categorical Variable)
We used a count plot to show the number of male and female passengers in the Titanic dataset. This helps us see if the dataset is balanced in terms of gender.
ðŸŸ¨ Example 2: Distribution of Age (Continuous Variable)
We used a histogram to visualize how passenger ages are distributed. This can help us identify age groups with higher representation or gaps in the data.
